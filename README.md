# Markdown Slides

The is a HTML/CSS template to create slides from a [markdown] file using
the `theme` command from David Parsons' [discount] implementation. It
uses CSS from Yihui Xie's [Snap Slides].

I don't claim this is suitable for anybody or anything but I like the
simplicity of the approach.

## Slide Organisation

Read [Snap Slides] for details and look at [example.md](example.md) for
a starting point.
